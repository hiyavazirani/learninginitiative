<h2> About Us </h2>

<p>
ML Learning is a new MIT Media Lab initiative that promotes creative learning:
 projects, peers, passion, and play. It ties together learning related research
  that takes place across different research groups, develops new technologies
  for creative learning, and uses the Media Lab as platform for new conversations
   about learning.
</p>

<h2> Creative Learning </h2>

<p>

<b>CREATE</b> <em>| krēˈāt |: bring (something) into existence </em>

</p>
<p>

We live in a world that is changing more rapidly than ever before.
Much of what we learn today will be obsolete tomorrow.
Success depends on our ability to think and act <b> creatively.</b> <br>


To thrive, we must learn to imagine creatively, reason systematically,
work collaboratively and learn continuously.
This is true not just for individuals, but for companies,
communities, and even nations as a whole.

</p>

<p>

At the MIT Media Lab, we are developing new technologies and strategies
for cultivating creative learning. Our approach is based on <b>four</b> guiding principles:

<div class="grid grid-pad">
   <div class="col-1-2">
     <div class="module">

<h5>Projects</h5>

We learn best when we are actively working on projects -
generating new ideas, designing prototypes,
making improvements and creating final products.

<h5>Peers</h5>

 Learning flourishes as a social activity,
with people sharing ideas, collaborating on projects,
and building on one another's work.

<h5>Passion</h5>

<p>When we focus on things we care about, we work longer and harder,
persist in the face of challenges, and learn more in the process.</p>

 </div>

 <div>

<img src="../assets/images/icons/play.png" alt="Play icon" style="width:30px;height:30px;">

<h5>Play</h5>

 Learning involves playful experimentation - trying new things,
tinkering with materials, testing boundaries, taking risks, iterating again and again.

</div>

We apply these principles to our own work within the Media Lab,
sparking creativity and innovation in our research.
And we share our creative-learning ideas and technologies
outside of the Lab, to help others engage in Media Lab-style learning.

Our goal: enable everyone everywhere to learn creatively -
Preparing ourselves and others for life in tomorrow's rapidly-changing world.
